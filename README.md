# CSS Practice - Flexbox and Grid

This CSS practice includes examples of using Flexbox and Grid for layout and building a responsive navbar. The code snippets demonstrate various techniques and properties to create flexible and responsive designs. Let's explore the code.

Flexbox for 1-dimensional layout

Flexbox is used for 1-dimensional layouts, where elements flow in either a horizontal or vertical direction. It provides flexibility in distributing space among items within a container.

Grid for 2-dimensional layout

Grid is used for 2-dimensional layouts, allowing elements to be placed in a grid-like structure with rows and columns. It provides more control over the placement and sizing of items within a container.

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
